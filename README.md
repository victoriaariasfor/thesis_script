The script gathers the transcriptions and the comments of a list of Youtube videos. Then rates the toxicity using Perspective API (https://perspectiveapi.com/), this rating is converted to a binary variable for analisis. The transcriptions are coded into sexist/feminist/neutral manually. Lastly, the script tests the hypothesis using multiple regressions.
